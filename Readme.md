# JBU-Cinemas Ecommerce web application

The Aim of the project is to improve my coding skills and understand the end-to-end implementation of ASP.NET MVC core web application (.NET 6) for a complete E-commerce solution with online payment checkout implementation. This application have admin and customer menu's.
